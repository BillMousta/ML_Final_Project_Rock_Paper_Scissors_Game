# ML_Final_Project_Rock_Paper_Scissors_Game

# Introduction
In the culminating project for our Machine Learning course, we were tasked with developing a machine learning agent to compete in the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors against a randomly playing opponent. The objective was to design an intelligent agent capable of recognizing the opponent's move and strategically countering it to secure a win. To achieve this, we employed a neural network model to empower our agent's decision-making capabilities, pitting it against an opponent that makes random choices
